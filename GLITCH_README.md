# Simple Guys Bot

If you're as concious as I am about the use of language in your Slack workspace, this will interest you.

With the existing [guys-bot-for-slack](https://glitch.com/~guys-bot-for-slack) needing some updates to work with the latest flavour of Slack API, I chose to recreate it using the most basic implementation of the Slack SDKs.

The bot responds with an ephemeral message, not seen by anyone but the user who originally messaged.

It requires the bot be invited into the channels you want it to listen on, so it can be implemented by individuals, or teams, as channels require, if that is what you want.

This guide has steps on the Slack API control panel. Please read [Who's a Good Bot? A Slack Bot For Inclusive Language](https://dev.to/lukeocodes/who-s-a-good-bot-a-slack-bot-for-inclusive-language-2fkh), the supporting blog post for this application, on how to set up your Slack App to retrieve your SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET and SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN.

## Installation Once Remixed

Update `.env` following the `.env.example` file supplied with the project.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

## Update Your Request URL

Once configured, head over to your Slack app's Event Subscription page (https://api.slack.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/event-subscriptions?) and update your request URL to be `https://<your-glitch-project>.glitch.me/slack/events`.
